# Vision-transformer
An implementation from scratch in PyTorch of the vision transformer architecture from the paper "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale". The architecture was then trained (for testing purposes) on the following dataset[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudreda55/satellite-image-classification]. The repository contains the source code organized in various folders, together with the jupyter notebook on which the model was initally written and tested. In order to make up for the small dataset, DataAugmentation (more specifically the AugMix algorithm) was used in the training phase.
