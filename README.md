# Vision-transformer
An implementation from scratch in PyTorch of the vision transformer architecture from the paper "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale". The architecture was then trained (for testing purposes) on the following dataset[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudreda55/satellite-image-classification]. In order to make up for the small dataset, DataAugmentation (more specifically the AugMix algorithm) was used in the training phase.
